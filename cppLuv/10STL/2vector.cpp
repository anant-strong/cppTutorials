//vector is dynamic array which stores memory in contigous manner like array
    //----how vector works-----
    // When std::vectorâ€™s internal memory completely finishes then it increases the size of its memory. To do that it performs following steps,

    // 1.) It will allocate a bigger chunk of memory on heap i.e. almost double the size of previously allocated.
    // 2.) Then it copies all the elements from old memory location to new one. Yes it copies them, so in case our elements are user defined objects then their copy constructor will be called. Which makes this step quite heavy in terms of speed.
    // 3.) Then after successful copying it deletes the old memory.
